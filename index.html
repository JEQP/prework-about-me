      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>A storysmith that has studied the code of life, I have tired of the meta and seek the code to that which we have created, rather than what we are.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was raised in the Street of Doom in a Sydney suburb that slipped between the regions. The doom has been fulfilled, my childhood home is no more, and the suburb is now "inner city". So for brevity let us say I come from Mexico.</p>
      <h1>What are your favourite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favourite hobbies are making my childhood abstract hobbies concrete. Where I used to collect books on gardening, now I garden. I used to come up with strategies for games, now I play them. Extrapolate from there.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My most consistent dream job is a covert agent, fleeing monsters and trying to achieve something important while - for some reason - naked. For a while that changed to Director of the Movie of my Dream, which was less embarrassing to talk about.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Too far away for the comfort of the course administrators, apparently.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am passionate to execute a career change into a vibrant and exciting industry! (That's right - I want to earn money)</p>
